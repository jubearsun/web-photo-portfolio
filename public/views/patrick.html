    				Patrick is a senior computer science major who enjoys dance, photography, and gaming. He can usually be found eating off of container lids in his co-op, flexing unnecessarily, taking basiq golden hour silhouette and high-bokeh portraits, or awkwardly body rolling in public. It has been his pleasure to serve on Innovative Designâ€™s officer board for his final semester!
